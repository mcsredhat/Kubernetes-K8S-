## Capstone Project 1: Multi-Cloud RBAC Architecture

### Scenario: Global E-Commerce Platform

You're the security architect for a global e-commerce company expanding to multiple cloud providers. Design a comprehensive RBAC system that handles:

#### Business Requirements:
- **3 Cloud Providers**: AWS EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS
- **5 Geographic Regions**: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East
- **4 Business Units**: Retail, Wholesale, Marketplace, Financial Services
- **12 Development Teams**: Frontend, Backend, Mobile, Data, ML, DevOps, Security, QA, Platform, Analytics, Payments, Compliance

#### Technical Constraints:
- Different compliance requirements per region (GDPR, CCPA, PCI-DSS)
- 99.99% availability requirements
- Zero-trust security model
- Automated disaster recovery across regions
- Real-time compliance monitoring

### Implementation Phase 1: Architecture Design

Create your architecture document:

```yaml
# multi-cloud-rbac-architecture.yaml
# Document your complete architecture design

# 1. Namespace Strategy
# How will you organize namespaces across clouds and regions?
# Example structure:
# - {business-unit}-{environment}-{region}-{cloud}
# - retail-prod-us-aws
# - wholesale-dev-eu-gke

# 2. Service Account Strategy  
# How will you handle service account federation across clouds?
# Consider: Cross-cloud authentication, token exchange, identity mapping

# 3. Role Hierarchy
# Design your role inheritance and composition strategy
# Consider: Base roles, environment-specific extensions, compliance overlays

# 4. Cross-Cloud Communication
# How will services in different clouds authenticate to each other?
# Consider: Service mesh integration, external secrets management

# Your architecture documentation goes here...

### Challenge Questions for Project 1:

1. **Cross-Cloud Authentication**: How will a service running in AWS EKS authenticate to a service in Google GKE? Design the complete authentication flow.

2. **Compliance Boundaries**: A European customer's data must never leave EU boundaries, but your ML team in the US needs to analyze aggregated patterns. How do you design RBAC to enforce this?

3. **Disaster Recovery**: If an entire region becomes unavailable, how do you maintain proper RBAC controls during failover? What are the security implications?

4. **Performance vs Security**: With global distribution, authentication checks could add latency. How do you balance security with performance requirements?

## Capstone Project 2: AI/ML Platform Security

### ML-Specific RBAC Challenges:

1. **Dynamic Resource Creation**: Data scientists create and destroy Jupyter notebooks frequently. How do you handle RBAC for ephemeral resources?

2. **Model Promotion Pipeline**: A model moves from experimentation ‚Üí validation ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production. How do different teams get appropriate access at each stage?

3. **Cross-Tenant Data Isolation**: Vehicle Manufacturer A's data must never be accessible to Manufacturer B, even by accident. How do you enforce this?

4. **Audit Trail Complexity**: For safety investigations, you need to trace every data point that influenced a model decision. How does RBAC support this?
